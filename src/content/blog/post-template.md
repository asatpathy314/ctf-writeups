## Introduction

Example Image for challenge

![hello](/ctf-writeups/assets/kkctf-padding.png)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello world");
}
```

## Section 1

`random inline code here`

## Section 2

The challenge description was a little on the nose about they used their "password as the secret key," so my first thought was to try `rockyou.txt`. For the sake of convenience I also translated `Decrypt` into python so I'll attach the solve script below.

## Section 3

Flag : `flagCTF{flag_here_lol}`

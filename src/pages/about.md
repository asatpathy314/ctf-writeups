I started this blog as a way to keep track of my CTF progress. Both because I already had some writeups but
nowhere to post them, and because I felt like having a place to make writeups would make me more motivated to
write them.

## Tech Stack

This website is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown is used for writeup content. Full disclosure the website is based off the theme [here](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). It was super useful, and helped me
dive right into configuring the website. Go and give it a star they deserve it!
